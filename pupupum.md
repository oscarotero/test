Interesting in how to integrate site and cms in terms of deployment. Does they should be different repositories? Or for example if I use github pages os only content can be placed here but cms should be... for example on deno deploy?

You can use the same repository for both, but you may need to deploy the cms on deno deploy, and the frontend/content in github pages.
